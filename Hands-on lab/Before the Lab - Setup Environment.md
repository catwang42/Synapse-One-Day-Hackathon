### What you need
To setup an environment with OpenEduAnalytics, you'll need:
* an Azure subscription (if you don't have an Azure subscription, you can set up a [free subscription here](https://azure.microsoft.com/free), or check the [current list of Azure offers](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/legal/offer-details/))
* role assignment of "Owner" on the Azure subscription you're using
* make sure your preferred subscription is selected as default \
`az account list --query "[].{SubscriptionId:id,IsDefault:isDefault,Name:name,TenantId:tenantId}"`\
`az account set --subscription <SubscriptionId>`
